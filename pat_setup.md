# How to add your Personal Access Token (PAT)

A Personal Access Token gives the program permission to read and write into the repository you specify which is neccessary to commit the markdown files.

`Fine-grained tokens` are access tokens that we can restrict to only allow access to the specific repo you'll be uploading your files, though a general PAT will also function (though not recommended).
